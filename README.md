# AntiEyeStrain

Work in progress

This is a project that aims to give the users alerts whenever they have been using phone or computers for 20 or more consequetive minutes.
The motivation behind this is to reduce eye strain. When the alert comes, users can be reminded to focus their eyes on distant objects and such
to avoid damaging their eyes.
